# textgame

EECS 368 Haskell Text-based adventure game

## First steps...

If Haskell Cabal is not installed, please install Haskell Cabal.
Instructions on how to install and use Haskell Cabal can be found at
https://www.haskell.org/cabal/

Otherwise make sure that GHC is also installed.

## Running the game...

If you have not ran cabal, please do so. You can use the game like so after
running cabal, but see dist/build/textgame/.textgame to run.

Note that the game was built and tested under a older version of the run command

I couldn't get the game to work on macOS Big Sur with the aformentioned cabal.
If running on macOS, use the branch <macOS-testing> and run <ghc --make Main.hs> in folder
macOS-instr
